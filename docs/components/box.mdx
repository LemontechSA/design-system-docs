Box is an abstract component that by default renders a `div` element.

## Import

```js
import { Box, Code } from "@suit-ui/react";
```

## Usage

It is recommended to use Box when you need to build layouts with Twind classes or when you need to build components using `as` prop.

```jsx
<Box as="span" className="text-primary-01 p2 hover:bg-secondary-01">
  This is a Box
</Box>
```

### as prop

You can use the `as` prop to change the element render.

<Box as="button" className="p-2 border rounded">
  Button
</Box>

```jsx
<Box as="button" className="p-2">
  Button
</Box>
```
