Box is the most abstract component on top of which all other Chakra UI components are built. By default, it renders a `div` element.

## Import

```js
import { Box } from "lemon-system";
```

## Usage

The Box component is useful because it helps with three common use cases:

- Create responsive layouts with ease.
- Provide a shorthand way to pass styles via props (bg instead of backgroundColor).
- Compose new component and allow for override using the as prop.

```jsx
<Box className="text-primary-01 p2 hover:bg-secondary-01">This is a Box</Box>
```

### as prop

You can use the `as` prop to change the element render, just like
styled-components.

<Box as="button" className="p-2 border rounded">
  Button
</Box>

```jsx
<Box as="button" className="p-2">
  Button
</Box>
```
